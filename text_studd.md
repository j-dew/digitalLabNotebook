# Notes on bold, italics, and strikethroughs

If you want **Bold** or *Italics* use asterisk on either side 2 for bold, 1 for italics.

You can also use underscores for the same effect __like this__ _or this_

If you want both, you can combine **_bold and italics_**

I think Strikethrough is done with ~tilde~
