# Lists and Bullet points

To create lists, begin a line with an asterisk or dash

* Rememer to use a space between the asterisk and the text.
* Nailed it
* Bullet points!!!

Same with a minus 

- it can only make bullet points in the preview thing
  - two spaces before a bullet point turn it into a sub-line.
      - four spaces goes even further
       - five?
         - no, but 6 does!
         
 Numbered lists go like this:
  1. Item 1
  2. Item 2
  32. Just use any number, the system will make the list sequential.
